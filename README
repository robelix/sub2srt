sub2srt  - Convert subtitles from ".sub" to SubRip ".srt" format

sub2srt is a simple tool to convert 2 common subtitle formats (MicroDVD
and SubViewer - both are known as ".sub") to SubRip ".srt" format.
This is the format ogmmerge accepts for multiplexing into ogm streams.
This format is also used by mkvmerge for multiplexing into mkv streams.


This is Beta Software!
Use it at your own risk! It works fine with several files I've got, but
it may fail with your's.
It's a quick hack written without any docs about the file formats - I
just had a look how the files look like.
Please report bugs, problems, patches... to sub2srt@robelix.com


What it does not:
-----------------
It does not - and will never - convert DVD-subtitles or VobSub.
Google on if you need this ;)


Installation:
-------------
Not necessary ;) - it's just a single perl-script.
But you may want to copy sub2srt to a directory that's in your $PATH -
like /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin.


Usage:
------
Run sub2srt --help to get more info.


Requirements:
-------------
Perl


License:
--------
GPL 2
Have a look to the file COPYING included in the archive.
